			<p>What is 'Chloride Site Generator'? Well, it's a simple program writting in C# that creates a website from a template and Markdown files. It began as a simple project when I wanted to create a simple website but I found <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> too damn fucking confusing to theme and use. I wanted something simple and fast, allowing me to work with HTML and using Markdown to create smaller websites quicker.</p>

<p>Thus, this project was born. I started slaving away on it near midnight and was up all night working on it. The finishing touches were made when I woke up. You can find the downloads on the Downloads page above.</p>
